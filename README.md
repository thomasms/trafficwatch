# Traffic Watch

### Uses Google API to get traffic data


Requires your own private Google API key - get one here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/

Note that you're limited to 2,500 calls within a 24 hour period.

Then simply create a file traffic/secrets/_apikey.py and set the key to variable API_KEY.

Try the tool - traffic/tools/routetime.py with your own route.
